# Electronic Safety Helmet  
The Electronic Safety Helmet is a smart safety device designed to enhance the protection of cyclists by detecting nearby vehicles and providing real-time alerts. The helmet integrates two sensors placed on either side and a rear-facing camera that constantly monitor the riderâ€™s environment. Whenever a vehicle comes within 2 meters, the system triggers an alert that is sent directly to the connected mobile application. The app displays different warning messages depending on how close the vehicle is, ensuring that the rider is always aware of potential dangers. At the same time, the application automatically records and saves a short video clip, capturing 3 seconds before and 3 seconds after the alert, which helps document incidents and near misses for later review or reporting. All alerts and recordings are stored within the app, creating a detailed history of safety events that can be analyzed to improve cycling habits and road awareness. By combining hardware and software in one integrated system, this project aims to reduce accidents, increase cyclist confidence, and provide valuable data for promoting safer roads.
